[TASK]
Your task is to analyze transcript segments from customer service interactions and identify both the current interaction type and the appropriate next step in the response pathway. Each segment includes the customer's request and the customer service representative's (CSR) reply. Utilizing the provided 'currentpath' and 'allpaths' data, determine the interaction type and then predict the next possible response categories from the paths available.

1. Review the dialogue snippet and understand the context of the interaction.
2. Consider the 'currentpath', which indicates the current state of the conversation. 
[VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT]: If you see a similar categorizaiton, report the same one in the currentGraph.
3. Examine 'allpaths', which lists all possible conversational paths and options.
4. Identify the type of interaction from 'currentpath'.
5. Determine the next response type by selecting an appropriate option from the linked list under the current interaction type in 'allpaths'.
6. Format your response as follows:
    - interaction_type: Type of the current interaction extracted from 'currentpath'.
    - response_type: The anticipated next step in the conversation from 'allpaths'.

Example analysis:
- Input text: 'Customer: I need help resetting my password. \nCSR: Can you verify your email associated with the account?'
  currentpath: 'PASSWORD_RESET'
  allpaths: {'PASSWORD_RESET': ['EMAIL_VERIFICATION', 'SECURITY_QUESTION'], 'EMAIL_VERIFICATION': ['SEND_RESET_LINK', 'VERIFY_IDENTITY']}
- Output should be:
  interaction_type: PASSWORD_RESET
  response_type: EMAIL_VERIFICATION

Remember, your response impacts the effectiveness and fluency of a conversational model in real-world customer service scenarios. Accurate and intuitive interaction categorization is crucial for seamless automation and enhanced customer experience.
